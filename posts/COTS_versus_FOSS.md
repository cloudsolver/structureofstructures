COTS, FOSS or FOSS+Support. Which one should you choose.

The answer: it depends. (Surprise)

Just because various software vendors don't invest in cross-platform software development doesn't mean you can't migrate to a new platform. COTS doesn't necessary mean vendor-locking, FOSS doesn't necessarily mean vendor independence and open standards.

This is the nature of competition between Free Open Source Software (FOSS) initiatives and established Commercial Off-The Shelf (COTS) Software manufacturers. Executives are faced with immeasurable intangibles and difficult decisions for IT investment. There are many ways to crack the puzzle.  

Here are 5 important things to ask yourself:

### 1. Ease of Integration

Open Standards - do you need the solution to be flexible and have ease of integration?

### 2. Flexibility and Extensibility
Do you predict a need to extend internal components or extend the core product?

### 3. Supportability

Do you have internal IT operations that need to support the solution ? Do you have skills in-house to support and diagnose?

### 4. Cost

Does it make sense to buy a product versus the support costs of FOSS?

These are a few factors that need to be evaluated. Solution architecture evaluations require a deep dive into specifics. ATAM(tm) is a framework for architecture evaluations that I have used, I plan to get certified and use it officially in engagements in the future.  It is a valuable guide to generate a Utility Tree and evaluate Quality Attributes.

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.
